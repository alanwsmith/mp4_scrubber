MP4 Scrubber

This is my tool for prepping MP4s for using
on websites. It removes any black bars and
drops any audio tracks. 

-- notes

- The process starts in the <<path|input_dir>>

- It searches recursively for any 
<<path|raw-mp4s>> directories and any <<path|.mp4>>
files in them

- When it finds one it runs the ffmpeg scrubbing
process on it and drops it into a sibling 
<<path|cropped-mp4s>> directory
